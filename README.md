# TestTask

TestTask was develop as a test task from the customer.

## Description

Create a Web application consisting of just one page.

The application will display an arbitrary “tree” of text nodes and provide the user with the ability to add new nodes and delete existing ones.

So, initially on the page shows the "root" of the tree (plain text with the inscription "root"). The “root” has one link: “add a node” (as a “+” sign). When you click on this link, the page should be updated, with the result that a new “node” with the inscription “node” should appear below and to the right of the “root”. A new node, like any other new nodes, should have two links: “add a node” (as a “+” sign) and “delete a node” (as an “-” sign). Clicking on the "-" page is updated, as a result of which the corresponding node and all its descendants are deleted. When you click on the "+" - an action similar to the above for the "root", with the only difference that the new node appears below and to the right of the node for which you clicked on the "+".
